Hi Im @nomogood
I'm interested in finding the correct API files to unlock my carier phone
however before I do that I will try to Download a file into git to upload into my smartwatch thru my android
this way I can get my bearings and hopefully learn a lot before trying to merge API's into my phone even tho it's an extra phone
IM a first timer & I'm having a blast thanks to all the umsung heroes before me that set all of this up, Thank you all
If your interested in helping me or asking me anything you can email me at ross11hall@gmail.com
